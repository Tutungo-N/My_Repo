# TrackBits Project

Brief Description:
TrackiBits is a habit tracking application designed to help users create and manage their daily habits effectively. The platform enables users to track their progress, stay motivated, and accomplish their goals with ease. 

This project is still a work in progress. I am still making incremental changes each passing day.
